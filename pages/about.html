            <h1 class="text-center p-2">Cutchi Memon Jamat Chakiwara</h1>
            <p>
                The province of Sindh has historical importance to us. The barren land of Sindh was honored by the
                arrival of great saints and divine personalities such as Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jilani, Pir Yousufuddin,
                Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, etc. Memons have been devout Muslims, and they bow and have bowed their
                heads in gratitude to Hazrat Pir Yousufuddin through whom they could find the divine path to Almighty
                Allah.

                Soon after their mass conversion, the new Muslims came to be known as “Momins”, which, with the passage
                of time, changed into “Memons”. Memons, being enterprising, soon started relocating from Sindh to other
                parts of India, particularly the Western part, and were known as Jetpur Memons, Halary Memons, Bantva
                Memons, Cutchi Memons depending on the place of their permanent location.

                Like other Memons, Cutchi Memons always looked forward. Their success and progress could be attributed
                mainly to the guidance provided by the holy personality, Barhwala Peer Saheb. They became devout Muslims
                through his spiritual guidance. When the Peer Sahib departed this earth, his successor continued to lead
                Cutchi Memons towards an enterprising life. Confirming themselves within the framework of Islamic
                ideology, Cutchi Memons relocated themselves to distant Indian cities such as Bombay, Madras, Poona, and
                Calcutta; some families moved into Sindh to settle in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas, and Karachi with a
                determination to earn their living through business and trade. Evidently, their determination met with
                success.

            <p>

                A look into history will reveal that Memons are among the oldest inhabitants of Sindh. They have been in
                this area since the middle of the 19th century as is seen from the following masjids built by them:
            </p>
            <p>

                Gulzar Masjid of Ghas Ganji built in 1856
                Memon Masjid of Gari Khata built in 1857
                Cutchi Memon Masjid of Ratantalao built in 1865
                Cutchi Memon Masjid of Saddar built in 1893
            </p>
            <p>

                The Cutchi Memons also built schools, hospitals, orphanages, etc through various charitable trusts,
                which continue to this day. The Cutchi Memon settlement in Sindh continued even after the formation of
                Pakistan. Cutchi Memons have been at the forefront to help build the nation. In order to have an
                effective presence in society and to continue welfare activities, Cutchi Memons formed seven separate
                Jamats in Bhimpura, Gari Khata, Saddar, Chakiwara, Ghas Ganji, Society and Kalri.
            </p>
            <p>

                The Bhimpura Jamat khana was built in 1889,
                The Saddar Jamatkhana in 1894,
                The Ghari Khata Jamatkhana in 1904.
                These Jamatkhanas were helpful in providing accommodation to travelers as well as for celebrating
                marriages. To further the cause of and to promote unity, Cutchi Memon elders formed a Jamat named “Gari
                Khata Cutchi Memon Jamat” in 1930. This Jamat’s formation was the beginning of a new era of unity and
                centralization of Cutchi Memons.
            </p>
            <p>

                After Partition and the formation of Pakistan, Cutchi Memons increased in population. On November 23,
                1975, Cutchi Memon students formed an association. They named it the Cutchi Memon Students’ Federation.
                Its objective was to provide a healthy atmosphere of educational and extracurricular activities. The
                Federation youth provided young and energetic blood to the ideology of Cutchi Memon brotherhood. The
                Federation also helped in the formation of new “Cutchi Memon Central Co-ordination Council”, which
                emerged as the “CUTCHI MEMON MARKAZI JAMAT“.
            </p>
            <p>
                Soon after its establishment in1985, the Council elected a body of seventeen members from the several
                Jamats
                to run the affairs. This Central Jamat comprises participants of six different Jamats, the total number
                being one hundred and two. Each Jamat nominated 4 members towards forming a Central Managing Committee
                of
                twenty-eight members.

                The Central Jamat’s Working committee has six office bearers (officers) namely, the Chairman, the Vice
                Chairman, Secretary General, Deputy Secretary General, Finance Secretary, and Secretary (Information).

                In addition and according to the Central Jamat’s constitution, the Chairman and Secretary of the Cutchi
                Memon Student Federation will be ex-officio members of the Markazi Jamat.

                The Central Jamat’s constitution defines limits of each of the six components. Accordingly, an adult
                Cutchi
                Memon can reside in any of the six defined boundaries, and can obtain membership of the respective
                Jamat. As
                each of the six components has its own resources/earnings from schools, institutions, hospitals, trusts,
                buildings etc it is supposed to contribute towards the budget of the Markazi Jamat.
